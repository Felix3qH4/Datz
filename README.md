## FAQ
- **Why is the App sometimes free and sometimes not?** Developing this App needs more than just my time. I need to pay 100$ yearly to Apple in order to distribute Datz! over the apple app store. The proceeds the app makes through sales are used to cover such expenses. (Trust me, the app does not generate much money, roughly 30$ a month. over 99% of the downloads are made when the app is free)

- **In which language should I communicate?** Whichever you want, I can speak English, Luxembourgish, German or French.
