For stupid me to remember

1. Change the All Classes Google Sheet
2. Download it as xlsx and replace the current file in this directory with it
3. open ExcelToJsonParser.py and select the updated column where it reads 'TODO select column'
4. cd assets
5. run 'python ExcelToJsonParser.py' which writes the current files to outputJSON.json
6. copy all the contents from that file to the desired file in Model/*-Classes.json
